# Learn_Russian
Start the application by running Russian.py DISCLAIMER: Still in production, not finished. 
The lessons still might be hard wich is why I'm still working on it.

Currently I'm working on an algorithm to see how well u are doing during the lesson 
and changing the next question depending on how fast u answerd previous questions and your answer streak.

In the screenshot for example you can see that there is still something I need to fix in the alphabet lesson this will be done soon.
